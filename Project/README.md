# CS5480-Project
Project repository for CS5480: Deep Learning offered in Spring 2018

### Objectives of the Project
-----------------------------

+ Test the benefits of hyper-parameter tuning using Random Search and Grid Search on neural network
    + Mode of evaluation is using the time taken, number of processes / amount of energy taken

+ Check whether **any** random ensemble of neural networks is as good or maybe better than a hyper-parameter optimized neural network
    + Mode of evaluation is classification accuracy
